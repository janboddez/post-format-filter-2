# Post Format Filter 2
Adds a Post Format filter to the admin Posts Screen.

This plugin is a fork of the 7-year-old [Post Format Filter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/post-format-filter/) plugin. I shortened the code a bit, removing outdated functionality and replacing global variables with proper WordPress functions that have since been introduced.

## To Do
- Add a filter for posts that lack a Post Format
- Add a sortable Post Format column to the Posts Screen
