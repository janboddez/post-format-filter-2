# Post Format Filter 2
Adds a Post Format filter to the WP Admin Posts Screen.

This plugin is a fork of the 7-year-old [Post Format Filter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/post-format-filter/) plugin by [Mark / t31os](https://profiles.wordpress.org/t31os_).

I shortened the code quite a bit, removing outdated functionality and replacing global variables with WordPress functions that have since been introduced.

**Of note:** This version now also allows filtering out **'Standard'** posts (or posts that lack a Post Format).
